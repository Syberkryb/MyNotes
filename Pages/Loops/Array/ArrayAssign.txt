Assigning values to an array in C# involves:

Array Declaration: Declare the array with its data type and size.
int[] numbers = new int[5];


Assignment: Assign values to individual elements using index notation.
numbers[0] = 10;
numbers[1] = 20;
numbers[2] = 30;

Initializing During Declaration: Initialize the array with values during declaration.
int[] numbers = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };

Assigning values to an array is a fundamental operation in C#, allowing you to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently.
