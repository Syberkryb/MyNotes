So often used without consideration for its magnificence, the humble 'variable' is the heart of computation. 
It can be used to store and manipulate data, and is the backbone of all computer programs. 
The 'variable' is a named container for a value, and can be of different types. 
The type of a variable determines what kind of value it can hold, and what kind of operations can be performed on it. 
There are many different types of variables, but the most common ones are 'int', 'string', 'float', and 'bool'. 
An 'int' is a whole number, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0. 
A 'string' is a sequence of characters, like ""Hello World"", ""I am a string"", and ""C# is awesome"". 
A 'float' is a decimal number, like 1.234, 5.678, and 9.101112. 
A 'bool' is a true or false value, like true and false. ";
