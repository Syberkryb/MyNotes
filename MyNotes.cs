In C#, variables are fundamental elements used for storing and manipulating data in a program. 
They serve as placeholders to store various types of values, such as numbers, text, and objects. 
Understanding how to declare, initialize, and use variables is crucial for writing effective C# code.

In C#, integers are a fundamental data type used to represent whole numbers. 
They are part of the family of primitive data types and are widely used in programming for various purposes. Here's an overview of integers in C#:

1.	Data Range: Integers in C# can represent a wide range of whole numbers, both positive and negative. The specific range and size of integers depend on the data type chosen. Common integer data types in C# include int, long, short, and byte. Each of these types has a different range of values it can store.
2.	Signed vs. Unsigned: Most integer data types in C# are signed, which means they can represent both positive and negative numbers. For example, int is a signed integer type. However, there are also unsigned integer types, such as uint and ulong, which can only represent non-negative numbers (zero and positive values).
3.	Default Values: When you declare an integer variable without initializing it explicitly, it is assigned a default value. For integers, the default value is typically 0.
